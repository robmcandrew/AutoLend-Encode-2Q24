# AutoLend-Encode-2Q24

This is our project for the Encode Rust/Solana 2Q24 Bootcamp

Inspired by flexlend.fi which optimizes for USDC/USDT lending across multiple defi protocols, we look to create a program which will accept SOL (or LST) deposits and regularly redeploy these assets across a selection of defi protocols to optimize lending returns.
